# Computational_Plant_Science_ML_Module
I am co-teaching the Computational Plant Sciences course in Spring 2025 at the University of Arizona. I taught the Machine Learning module, and all related coding exercises are available here on GitHub.


* Class_V1_V1.py -> Generate a 2D rectangle of size 200 x 200 with a smaller rectangle inside at random positions, developed in Class 2/18.
* Class_V1_V2.py -> This version generates a 2D rectangle of size 200 x 200 with a smaller rectangle inside at random positions using a function, serving as a reference for self-study.
* Class_V1_V3.py -> Generate a 2D rectangle of size 200 x 200 with a smaller square inside at random positions, serving as a reference for self-study.

* Class_2_V1.py -> Generates 1000 2D rectangles (200x200), each with a smaller rectangle inside at random positions, using a function. Developed in Class 2/20.
* Class_2_V1.py -> This version generates 1000 2D rectangles (200x200), each with a smaller square inside at random positions, using a function, serving as a reference for self-study.
* Class_2_V1.py -> Shape Dataset Generation: This version generates 1000 2D rectangles (200x200), each with a smaller rectangle inside at random positions, and another 1000 rectangles with a smaller square, serving as a reference for self-study.


* Class_3_V1.py -> Split the dataset (from the previous code) into training and testing sets (80/20 split), implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and train and test the model, developed in Class 2/25.
* Class_3_V2.py ->This version trained the model, saved it in .pkl format, as a reference for self-study.
* Class_3_V3.py -> This version visualizes the test shape prediction results.

* Class_4_V1.py -> Load the pretained model (from previous code), and test it, developed in Class 2/27
* Class_4_V2.py -> This version load the pretained model, visualizes the test shape prediction results, serving as a reference for self-study.
* Class_4_V3.py -> This version loads the pretrained model, organizes data generation and processing into functions for conciseness, and tests it with the pretrained model, serving as a reference for self-study.

* Class_5_V1.py -> A real public disease dataset from PlantVillage is loaded and stored in variables, developed in Class 3/4.
* Class_5_V2.py -> Split the real dataset, into training and testing, and trained with CNN, serving as a reference for self-study.
* Class_5_V3.py -> This version of code, save the model, and load it for testing, serving as a reference for self-study.

* Class_6_V1.py -> The disease detection model, developed with slight changes to the CNN architecture from the last class, is explained again, developed in Class 3/6.
